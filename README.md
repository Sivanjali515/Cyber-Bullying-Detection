# Cyber-Bullying-Detection
Abstract:Cyberbullying has emerged as a significant concern in online platforms, particularly on social media, where 
harmful content can spread rapidly. This project aims to develop an intelligent system for cyberbullying 
detection using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The system 
processes textual data from Twitter, embedding it with Word2Vec for semantic understanding and 
employing a Random Forest Classifier for classification tasks. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, 
including cleaning, sentiment analysis using the VADER Sentiment Analyzer, and oversampling to address 
class imbalance. The application integrates a Streamlit-based interface, offering features such as data 
visualization, predictions, and detailed reports. It provides users with interactive components for uploading 
datasets, training models, and visualizing insights, such as sentiment distribution and confusion matrices. 
By leveraging advanced text embedding and classification techniques, the system delivers accurate 
predictions, aiding in identifying harmful online behavior. The project not only focuses on model accuracy 
but also prioritizes accessibility and ease of use, ensuring it can be utilized by researchers, educators, and 
policymakers. Through real-time predictions and comprehensive reporting, this system aims to 
contribute to creating a safer online environment by effectively identifying and addressing instances of 
cyberbullying.
